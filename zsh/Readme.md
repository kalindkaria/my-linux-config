# Zsh Configurations

## Features
- minimal
- builtin plugin manager(just requires 9 line long of function)
- git support in prompt
- cool aliases
- handy shortcuts

## Recomendations
I recommend to install some programs which I have already integrated some keybindings.

### Debian based 
```
sudo apt install ranger exa fzf 
```

### Arch based
```
sudo pacman -S ranger exa fzf fd 
```
