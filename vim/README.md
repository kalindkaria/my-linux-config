# Vim Configurations

## Before we begin:
The “vimrc” (Vim resource configuration) file provides initialization settings that configure Vim every time it starts. This file can be found in “$HOME/.vimrc” for Linux/OSX and “$HOME/_vimrc” for Windows users. Inside Vim, type “:echo $HOME” to see the value of “$HOME” for your system.

--> To see the content files you might have to enable hidden files

## Use this configuration:
Just copy everyhing in this directory to home folder(linux users)

`mkdir ~/.cache/vim`
